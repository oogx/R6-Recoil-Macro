# Rainbow Six Siege Recoil Macro

Stopped working on this project about 5 months ago, so dont expect all recoil values to be the same. Sights and attachments need adjusting as i didnt figure out the math to automate it. Feel free to use this source and fix/update it. Just ignore the poor code it started as proof of concept.
## Features
>- Using a Arduino Leonardo and Usb Host Shield to move mouse to avoid Battle Eye (The anticheat).
>- Auto get and apply recoil values based on weapon and attachments.
>- Swap between weapons and change to the recoil of secondary.
>- Auto apply settings based of configs and last used weapon attachments.
